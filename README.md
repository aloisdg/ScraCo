# ScraCo

ScraCo is a (n almost) complete library to use [ColorHexa.com](http://www.colorhexa.com/) output.

## Caveat

ScraCo was firstly made to extract data to create unit tests for [Harmony](https://github.com/aloisdg/Harmony).
Feel free to use it, but I advice to switch to [Harmony](https://github.com/aloisdg/Harmony).
[ColorHexa.com](http://www.colorhexa.com/) is a great website, no need to harm them with to much scraping.
Also, [Harmony](https://github.com/aloisdg/Harmony) works fully offline.

## Dependency

ScraCo use heavily [AngleSharp](https://github.com/AngleSharp/AngleSharp/) to scrap all this juicy data from [ColorHexa.com](http://www.colorhexa.com/).
[AngleSharp](https://github.com/AngleSharp/AngleSharp/) is a great library for scraping. If you like the HTML Agility Pack, you will love this one. Go check it!
